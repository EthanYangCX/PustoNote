*These sounds are pronounced only when the letter is at the beginning of the word or at the beginning of a syllable. Otherwise, the other sound is usually the one that is pronounced.

**A common example for the use of "א" as a silent letter is the word לא (/lo/), which means "no".

## The letter "vav" (ו)

The basic sound of the letter "vav" is "v". However, it is also used in Hebrew as the vowel "u" and "o".

For example:

    אוהב = (ohev).

    הוא = (hu).

## The Hebrew Vowels

In Hebrew the vowels aren't represented by letters, but by dots and dashes that appear around the letters. These dots and dashes are called nekudot (נקודות), and the system that they make up is known as nikud (ניקוד). (Note: a common mistake for beginners is to refer to them as nikudot. This word doesn't exist.) Nikud isn't used much in modern Hebrew so we will learn how to read without it (see Letters 3). Think of it a bit like "text speak" in English. You know what "hw abt nxt wdnsday?" means because your brain inserts the right vowels automatically.

Some words are written with the same letters but have different nikud and are pronounced differently - without the dots, the pronunciation can often be determined by context. In this case we will help you by adding nikud where necessary.

Please Note! when writing your Hebrew answers, don't use the vowels - just write words without vowels.

Here is a table of the most common ones (where we will use א as an example carrier letter):
Vowel 	IPA 	English example
אְ 	silent/e 	mm (long sound), yet
אָ אַ 	a 	bank
אֶ אֵ 	e 	bed
אִ 	i 	beep
אֹ 	o 	bog
אֻ 	u 	zoo

In addition, the letter "ו" can carry two kinds of vowels:
Vowel 	IPA 	English example
וֹ 	o 	bog
וּ 	u 	zoo
"Dagesh"

As well as denoting vowels, dots can be used to explicitly distinguish between letters that have two different pronunciations:
Letter 	Pronunciation with dot 	Pronunciation without dot
ּב 	b 	v
ּכ 	k 	kh
ּפ 	p 	f

In technical terms the letters with the dot are plosives, and are usually used at the start of a syllable, while the letters without the dot are fricatives and are usually used at the end of a syllable. In writing without nikud, a letter without a dot could have either pronunciation, but its position in the syllable will help you guess the right pronunciation. For example:

kélev כלב (start of syllable)
mélekh מלך (end of syllable)

The letter שׁ, with a dot at the top right represents "sh", while שׂ, with the dot at the top left, represents "s".

# 冠词

Articles

Hebrew has only a definite article (i.e. "the"). This means that there are no indefinite articles (i.e. "a/an"). In order to add the definite article to a noun we simply attach the letter ה to the beginning of the noun.

For example:

ילד - boy/a boy (yéled)

הילד = ה + ילד - the boy (the "ה" as a definite article is pronounced Ha - i.e. hayéled).

# 连词

## Connecting words

In order to connect words in Hebrew using the word "and", we attach the letter ו (vav) to the beginning of the second word. When using it to connect words, the letter ו will usually sound like "ve".

For example:

ילדה - a girl ( yalda)

ילדה וילד = ילדה ו + ילד - a girl and a boy (yalda veyeled)

We can also use both ה and ו together ("the" and "and"):

והילד = ו + ה + ילד - and the boy (ve-ha-yeled)

# 句法

## Yes/No questions

Yes/No questions in Hebrew do not change the sentence structure. You can simply add a question mark in writing, and in speech, you can use a questioning intonation.

For example:

    אני אבא (aní ába) - I am a father.

    ?אני אבא (aní ába?) - Am I a father?

We can also add the word "האם" (ha-ím) in order to emphasize that a question is being asked, but it is considered formal, and is therefore not very common in spoken Hebrew.

For example:

    אני אבא (aní ába) - I am a father.

    ?האם אני אבא (ha-ím aní ába?) - Am I a father?

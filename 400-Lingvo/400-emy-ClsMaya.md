**Classic Maya** (or properly **Classical Ch'olti'**) is the oldest historically attested member of the Maya linguistic family. It is the main language documented in the pre-Columbian inscriptions of the classical period of the Maya civilization.[1] It is also a direct descendant of Proto-Mayan (as are Wastek and Yucatec) and the common ancestor of the Cholan branch of Mayan languages. Contemporary descendants of classical Maya include Ch'ol and Ch'orti'. Speakers of these languages can understand many Classic Mayan words.

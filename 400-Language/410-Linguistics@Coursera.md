## M3 Morphology & syntax

### V1 Words and sentences

- Words with much/little info (turkish/chinese)
- Lan differ in the way words are organized (dutch/apalai)
- Morphology: Study of word structure
- Syntax: Study of sentence structure

### V2 Morphology

- Question:
  - What does human language consist of?
  - First answer: words
- Criteria for words
  - Three criteria:
    - Spaces
      - A word is inbetween spaces
      - Most languages are spoken
      - Passion fruit
    - Meaning
      - A word is one meaningful concept
      - Passion fruit is a single concept
      - Waht is a concept
    - Pronunciation
      - A word is one form that cannot be interrupted
      - Prosody: the way in which we pronounce words and sentences together
      - Space within words possible
  - Conclusion: all  three criteria play a role
- Part of words
  - Example: uncovering = base and affix (prefis, suffix)
  - Morphemes:
    - Languages use morphemes to different degrees
    - Different types of languages
      - Isolating: 
        - words is one morpheme
        - few combinations
        - e.g. Chinese
      - Agglunative:
        - Lot of morphemes
        - Transparant way of combining
        - e.g. Turkish
      - Fusional:
        - e.g. Arabic
          - Affixes, changes internal to the base
      - Polysynthetic:
        - Combine bases and affixes endlessly
        - e.g. Mohawk
- Classification
  - English: somewhere between fusional and isolating, and some agglutinative
- Summary
  - Four types of langusges
    - According to their morphology

### V3 Discussion

- Do some languages have more words than others?
- How do we know where word boundaries are?
- How do children learn word boundaries?


### V4a Syntax & word order

- S, o and v
  - Labels for words
  - Subj.
    - What the sentence is about
    - Perforner of the action
    - If subkect changes, verb can change
  - Obj.
    - Other nominal thing
    - Not the subject
  - Verb
    - Changes when subject changes
    - Cescribes the action
  - Word orders:
    - 6 possibilities
    - e.g.
      - SVO en
      - SOV turkish ko
      - VSO Tagalog
      - VOS Malagasy
      - OSV Xavante
      - OVS Hixkaryana
- Longer sentences
  - subject
    - noun: describe entities in the real world
    - adjective: describe qualities of entities in the real world
    - 2 possible orders:
      - AN
      - NA
  - Prepositions: describe relations
    - postpositions

### V4b Syntax & word order

- Tendencies
  - some orders stick together
  - typologists: study correlations in word orders
  - we can make predictions
    - SVO, NA, prepositions (e.g. French)
      - not English
    - ja: SOV, AN, postposition
- Question words
  - en: question word moves from object-position to beginning of sentence
  - ja: ques' word unchange

### V3 Discussion word orders

- Are word order divided equally among languages?
- Why are some word orders more frequent than others? (S before O; gesture always naturally SOV)
- Why are there languages that do not have these most frequent basic wordnorders? (other factors)
- Is linguistics a science? (factors always attached)

### V6 Interview Dr. Noam Chomsky


## M4 The study of meaning: Pragmatics and Semantics

### V1 Layers of meaning

- So far:
  - Form of lang
- Now: Meaning
  - Meaning
    - Semantic meaning: literal, testable
    - Pragmatic ``: what you want to achieve.; why does the speaker say this.; to inform; to order; to apologize; is about context
- Two layers of meaning
  - semantics
  - pragmatics
  - outside linguistics textbooks, no sentences exist without pragmatics
  - there is always an implicit I and an implicit you
  - I -> you

### V2 Semantics

- Semantics:meaning of words
  - orange
    - not all lang have a word for 'orange'
    - some lang have one word for green and blue (e.g. Tzeltal)
    - some devide the spectrum into white black and red (e.g. Bellonese)
  - all languages distinguish: dark colors, light colors
  - next: red, green/yellow, blue
  - debate universals
    - ethnocentrism (western frame)
    - are aspects of human languages universal?
    - given by human biology?
    - influenced by the surrounding culture?
  - debate language & thought
    - few color-terms, more difficult to distinguish colors?
    - everyone sees the difference
    - knowing color terms may give advantage:
      - quicker in taking the relevant decision
      - just more experiences in making this distinction

### V3

- do the inuit really have 100 words for snow?
- what anout words denoting shades of meaning such as 'salmon', 'light blue'
- how many words for 'snow' do the inuit languages have
- can we ever get to an appropriate definition of a word? why not?

### V4 Pragmatics

- performative meaning 1
  - some sentences express more than just true or false information
  - speech acts
    - sentences that change the world (J. L. Austin)
  - not true or false
- performative meaning 2
  - making a change by not saying something
  - ignoring pragmatics
  - maxims
    - rules that participants have conversation
    - quantity: provide enough information

### V5 discussion

- what is the meaning of questions
- what is the meaning of orders
- how do we follow the Grecian maxim without knowing about it?
- what kind of law is the maxim of Grice

### V6

- do 'future words' influence present words
- do you make the same mistakes in a second language
- does the foreign accent syndrome exist

### v4 Reading in the brain

  - different, based on different linguistic structures
    - latin: phoneme-based
    - kana: syllable-based
    - han: morpheme-based
    - hangul: phoneme-based (phonological feature)
- diversity and similarity
  - why is all reading in the same place

    - Interaction between people
    - Studied by sociolinguistics
- Sociolinguistics topics
    - Language change
    - Language variation
- Classifying
    - Classifying individual differences
        - Genetically: language into families
        - Geographically: dialects into languages
            - *为啥同一地区语言倾向于相似？答：互相交流，互借元素。*
        - Social variables: age, gender, social class (wealth, education)
            - c'est `sociolects`
            - `idiolects`: the personal, unique mixture of language features a speaker has
- Why language variation
    - *语言不止以交流，亦以示是谁*
    - Language not only used for transfr of information
    - Also for showing identity
        - e.g. like you wear certain clothes

### V2 社会阶层化 Social Stratification

- Labov's study
    - age
        - X-axis e defferent age groups, y- e measurement fronting
        - *为何与理解语言习得有关？答：展示了学习者必须知道语言在特定方向移动*
    - social class: 
        - differences between lower and upper class
        - defined in terms of: income, level of education, a combination
        - 不同线代表不同阶级
        - LWC, LMC both change but class-difference stays the same
            - showed that nevertheless the class-difference was preserved
    - gender
        - 男比女慢一代；
        - 女似直线男有平段
    - explaining
        - all children learn from their mothers 
        - for girls peer group becomes around age 5/6
        - bots learn language of mother and stay put
        - *这代表费城元音会不断前移？答：不，受物理限制。*
        - peer group becomes important for men around age 20
    - conclusion 
        - tow sides of the same coin: language variation, language change

### V3 Discussion over social variables

- How do the variable age work? gender? （它俩不变；文化上男女非离散）
    - *问：Labov的研究中性别特征的可变性有实质影响么？答：不，统计地，男女仍异。*
- How do the variable social class work? （似乎不是与生俱来，但有一部分是来自父母的）
- How culture-specific is the variable of gender/sicial class?
    - *Inge的观察（主要是成年男性上班，所以只有男性那段水平线）意味着此研究与文化相关？答：要重复实验才知道。*
- And would this be the same for social class?

### V4 礼貌 Politeness

- Classifying individual differences
    - *田中用的词为什么和教授不同？答：教授用谦语是不礼貌的。*
- Politeness
    - ways to express relations between people
- 面子 face
    - public self-image
    - Penelope Brown & Stephen Levinson
    - 消极面子 `negative face`: u don't want others to hinder your actions

        - in every conversation, the face of both speaker and hearer is at stake
            - A命令B：B的消极面子受损
            - A接受B的道歉：A的消极面子受损
            - A向B道歉：A的积极面子受损
            - A批评B：B的积极面子受损
            - *为什么贬低自己是一种礼貌动作？答：积极面子受损*
- politeness and intrculturality
    - 不同文化不同礼貌策略

### V5 discussion: examples of face

- How does nothion of 'face' works for the speaker?
    - 听者的消极：让他更自由
    - 说者的消极：道歉*为啥？答：使更不自由（下次不能再做）*
    - 听者的积极：让他被认可
    - 说者的积极：谦虚
- example: 想让很晚来吃晚饭的朋友离开
    - *最有礼貌的是做啥？答：nothing*（对方想咋办咋办）
    - 最不礼貌的：直接让滚。
- do these strategies differ per culture?

### V6 Interview with Prof. Adele Goldberg

### Reading 

### Quiz 6

- What does the fact that languages change reveal according to sociolinguists?
    - people use language to show their identity; every language changes bcuz the idea of identity changes
    - 错误的答案：lang changes according to its own inherent laws, which are not influenced by human behavior
- Many languages may go extinct in the next century because people teach their children a language spoken by many, believing that they will have a better future if they learn that language as their only mother tongue. What is the right response to this, according to the LSA?
    - Linguists should inform people that it is not necessary to give up their own language when learning another one, since people can be bilingual.
- Figure 2 in William Labov’s article ‘A life of learning’ shows data about the way in which /r/ is pronounced in New York. What conclusion can we draw from these data?
    - People in New York all pronounce more /r/’s when they speak carefully than when they do not, but there are always differences between social classes.

- T13 What do typologists do primarily? -- They compare and classify languages based on different dimension, such as word order
- T16 How come that all human sentences in dialogue have some layer of pragmatic meaning? -- Human speakers do not utter sentences without the intension of affecting the listener in some way
- T17 Take a look at the following sentence. Which of the following statements holds of this sentence?
    - > "The design was never built, because it was too expensive’.
    - This sentence shows how humans can easily mix abstract and concrete meanings of the same word in one sentence

- T27 Do people make the same kind of speech errors in a second language as in their first language? -- Yes, the problems are very similar, although you may have more specific problems in a second language, for instance due to stress 
- T28 Why do linguists study reading less than listening? -- Reading is considered less natural, for instance bcuz many human beings do not know how to do it
- T29 Why do researchers use vocoders to study the effects of cochlear implants on language hearing? -- With a vocoder, one can distort the speech signal in a way that is very similar to what peoplewith a cochlear implant hear

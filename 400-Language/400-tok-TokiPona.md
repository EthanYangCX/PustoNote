Toki Pona (rendered as toki pona[a] and often translated as 'the language of good';[b] IPA: [ˈtoki ˈpona] (listen); English: /ˈtoʊki ˈpoʊnə/) is a philosophical artistic constructed language (philosophical artlang) known for its small vocabulary, simplicity, and ease of acquisition.[4] It was created by Sonja Lang, a Canadian linguist and translator,[4][5] to simplify thoughts and communication. The first drafts were published online in 2001,[1] while the complete form was published in the book Toki Pona: The Language of Good in 2014.[6][7] Lang also released a supplementary dictionary, the Toki Pona Dictionary, in July 2021, based on community usage.

V1 Words and sentences

- Words with much/little info (turkish/chinese)
- Lan differ in the way words are organized (dutch/apalai)
- Morphology: Study of word structure
- Syntax: Study of sentence structure

V2 Morphology

- Question:
  - What does human language consist of?
  - First answer: words
- Criteria for words
  - Three criteria:
    - Spaces
      - A word is inbetween spaces
      - Most languages are spoken
      - Passion fruit
    - Meaning
      - A word is one meaningful concept
      - Passion fruit is a single concept
      - Waht is a concept
    - Pronunciation
      - A word is one form that cannot be interrupted
      - Prosody: the way in which we pronounce words and sentences together
      - Space within words possible
  - Conclusion: all  three criteria play a role
- Part of words
  - Example: uncovering = base and affix (prefis, suffix)
  - Morphemes:
    - Languages use morphemes to different degrees
    - Different types of languages
      - Isolating: 
        - words is one morpheme
        - few combinations
        - e.g. Chinese
      - Agglunative:
        - Lot of morphemes
        - Transparant way of combining
        - e.g. Turkish
      - Fusional:
        - e.g. Arabic
          - Affixes, changes internal to the base
      - Polysynthetic:
        - Combine bases and affixes endlessly
        - e.g. Mohawk
- Classification
  - English: somewhere between fusional and isolating, and some agglutinative
- Summary
  - Four types of langusges
    - According to their morphology

V3 Discussion

- Do some languages have more words than others?
- How do we know where word boundaries are?
- How do children learn word boundaries?


v4a Syntax & word order

- S, o and v
  - Labels for words
  - Subj.
    - What the sentence is about
    - Perforner of the action
    - If subkect changes, verb can change
  - Obj.
    - Other nominal thing
    - Not the subject
  - Verb
    - Changes when subject changes
    - Cescribes the action
  - Word orders:
    - 6 possibilities
    - e.g.
      - SVO en
      - SOV turkish ko
      - VSO Tagalog
      - VOS Malagasy
      - OSV Xavante
      - OVS Hixkaryana
- Longer sentences
  - subject
    - noun: describe entities in the real world
    - adjective: describe qualities of entities in the real world
    - 2 possible orders:
      - AN
      - NA
  - Prepositions: describe relations
    - postpositions

V4b Syntax & word order

- Tendencies
  - some orders stick together
  - typologists: study correlations in word orders
  - we can make predictions
    - SVO, NA, prepositions (e.g. French)
      - not English
    - ja: SOV, AN, postposition
- Question words
  - en: question word moves from object-position to beginning of sentence
  - ja: ques' word unchange

V3 Discussion word orders

- Are word order divided equally among languages?
- Why are some word orders more frequent than others? (S before O; gesture always naturally SOV)
- Why are there languages that do not have these most frequent basic wordnorders? (other factors)
- Is linguistics a science? (factors always attached)

# M4 The study of meaning: Pragmatics and Semantics

V1 Layers of meaning

- So far:
  - Form of lang
- Now: Meaning
  - Meaning
    - Semantic meaning: literal, testable
    - Pragmatic ``: what you want to achieve.; why does the speaker say this.; to inform; to order; to apologize; is about context
- Two layers of meaning
  - semantics
  - pragmatics
  - outside linguistics textbooks, no sentences exist without pragmatics
  - there is always an implicit I and an implicit you
  - I -> you

V2 Semantics

- Semantics:meaning of words
  - orange
    - not all lang have a word for 'orange'
    - some lang have one word for green and blue (e.g. Tzeltal)
    - some devide the spectrum into white black and red (e.g. Bellonese)
  - all languages distinguish: dark colors, light colors
  - next: red, green/yellow, blue
  - debate universals
    - ethnocentrism (western frame)
    - are aspects of human languages universal?
    - given by human biology?
    - influenced by the surrounding culture?
  - debate language & thought
    - few color-terms, more difficult to distinguish colors?
    - everyone sees the difference
    - knowing color terms may give advantage:
      - quicker in taking the relevant decision
      - just more experiences in making this distinction

V3

- do the inuit really have 100 words for snow?
- what anout words denoting shades of meaning such as 'salmon', 'light blue'
- how many words for 'snow' do the inuit languages have
- can we ever get to an appropriate definition of a word? why not?

V4 Pragmatics

- performative meaning 1
  - some sentences express more than just true or false information
  - speech acts
    - sentences that change the world (J. L. Austin)
  - not true pr false
- performative meaning 2
  - making a change by not saying something
  - ignoring pragmatics
  - maxims
    - rules that participants have conversation
    - quantity: provide enough information

V5 discussion

- what is the meaning of questions
- what is the meaning of orders
- how do we follow the Grecian maxim without knowing about it?
- what kind of law is the maxim of Grice

# M5 Language in the Brain

V1 introduction

- this module
  - how do we produce language
  - how do we understand language
  - what parts of the brain do we use
  - what happens when something goes wrong
  - how does reading work
- relation lang - brain
  - brain made lang
  - lang made brain
- liguists work in
  - lib
  - closet
  - street
  - lab
- psycholinguistics
  - linguistic behaviour
- neurolinguistics
  - what happens where in the brain
- origins of psycholinguistics
  - small experiments
  - study of children's development
  - study of patients
- neurolinguistics
  - what happens where in the brain
  - which parts do what

V2 aphasia

- Three important parts
  - Wernicke's area (Left of brain)
  - Broca's area (Right of brain)
  - Arcuate fasciculus
- Language-related problems
  - often called aphasia
  - aphasia can mean different things
- Wernicke's aphasia
  - fluent speech
  - grammatical
  - meaningless
  - problem connecting form and content
  - problems with understanding
- broca's aphasia
  - non-fluent speech
  - ungrammatical
  - meaningful
  - no problems understanding
  - problem with word and sentence formation
- conduction aphasia
  - fluent speech
  - grammatical
  - meaningful
  - problems with repeating
- understanding and classification

V3 Disussion: everyday mistakes and the Foreign Accent Syndrome

- are small everyday linguistic errors examples of mild aphasia?
- can we create speech errors with tongue twisters
- do 'future words' influence present words
- do you make the same mistakes in a second language
- does the foreign accent syndrome exist

v4 Reading in the brain

- writing systems
  - different, based on different linguistic structures
    - latin: phoneme-based
    - kana: syllable-based
    - han: morpheme-based
    - hangul: phoneme-based (phonological feature)
- diversity and similarity
  - why is all reading in the same place
    - innate? does not seem possible

# 参数传递

（例Java，IntList.dSquareList()，不记得了去问 moZ12Te21q-Te22HiZ12q-Seo12ba21BeLH21）对象作为参数，则，形参是一个新的变量名，指向原来对象的内存空间，形参再动也不影响实参及其指向的位置

# OOP

## three major pillars 封装と继承と多態という三大特性

There are three major pillars on which object-oriented programming relies: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## SOLID という Principles

The SOLID ideas are

- The Single-responsibility principle: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change." In other words, every class should have only one responsibility. 单一功能原则
- The Open–closed principle: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification." 开闭原则
- The Liskov substitution principle: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it." See also design by contract. 里氏替换原则（相当于说子类可以替代基类）
- The Interface segregation principle: "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use." 接口隔离原则
- The Dependency inversion principle: "Depend upon abstractions, not concretions." 依赖反转原则

### Depen Inver

In software engineering, dependency injection is a technique whereby one object (or static method) supplies the dependencies of another object. A dependency is an object that can be used (a service).

- ( dependencies can be injected at runtime rather than at compile time)
- Starting with Spring 2.5, the framework introduced annotations-driven Dependency Injection. The main annotation of this feature is @Autowired. It allows Spring to resolve and inject collaborating beans into our bean. (https://www.baeldung.com/spring-autowire)

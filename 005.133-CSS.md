# Extensions & Frameworks

## Tailwind

> A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

思想是不以组件（如按钮）优先，而以用途（属性，样式元素，「工具程式型」）优先。

## Sass and `.scss`

> Sass is a CSS pre-processor with syntax advancements. Style sheets in the advanced syntax are processed by the program, and turned into regular CSS style sheets. However, they do not extend the CSS standard itself.
> 
> CSS variables are supported and can be utilized but not as well as pre-processor variables.

关于 `.scss` 和 `.sass`

> The SCSS syntax uses the file extension `.scss`. With a few small exceptions, it’s a superset of CSS, which means essentially **all valid CSS is valid SCSS as well**. Because of its similarity to CSS, it’s the easiest syntax to get used to and the most popular.
>
> The indented syntax was Sass’s original syntax, and so it uses the file extension `.sass`. Because of this extension, it’s sometimes just called “Sass”. The indented syntax supports all the same features as SCSS, but it uses indentation instead of curly braces and semicolons to describe the format of the document.

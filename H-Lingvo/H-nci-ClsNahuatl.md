> **Classical Nahuatl** (also known simply as **Aztec** or **Nahuatl**) is any of the variants of Nahuatl spoken in the Valley of Mexico and central Mexico as a lingua franca at the time of the 16th-century Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. During the subsequent centuries, it was largely displaced by Spanish and evolved into some of the modern Nahuan languages in use today (other modern dialects descend more directly from other 16th-century variants). Although classified as an extinct language,[1] Classical Nahuatl has survived through a multitude of written sources transcribed by Nahua peoples and Spaniards in the Latin script.

> **古典纳瓦特尔语**有时也被简称为**阿兹特克语**或**纳瓦特尔**语，指16世纪西班牙征服阿兹特克帝国前后于墨西哥谷地起通用语效用的各纳瓦特尔语变体，都是黏着语。在随后的时代，古典纳瓦特尔语的地位逐渐为西班牙语所代替，并发展为现代的纳瓦语族诸语言[注 1]。

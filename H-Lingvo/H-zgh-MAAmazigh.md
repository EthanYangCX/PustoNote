**Standard Moroccan Amazigh** (Standard Moroccan Tamazight: ⵜⴰⵎⴰⵣⵉⵖⵜ ⵜⴰⵏⴰⵡⴰⵢⵜ; Arabic: الأمازيغية المعيارية), also known as **Standard Moroccan Tamazight**, is a standardized language developed by the Royal Institute of Amazigh Culture (IRCAM) in Morocco by combining features of Tashelhit, Central Atlas Tamazight, and Tarifit, the three major Amazigh languages in Morocco.[2][3][1][4] It has been an official language of Morocco since 2011.[3][5]

Standard Moroccan Amazigh is typically referred to as Tamazight, Amazigh, or Berber, although these terms can also be used to refer to any other Amazigh language, or to Amazigh languages as a whole, including those outside Morocco.[3][1][4][6]

ISO 639-2 / 5 for Berber languages is `ber`

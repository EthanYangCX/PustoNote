# Ruby on Rails

> Rails (usually referred to as "Ruby on Rails") is a web framework written for the Ruby programming language.

> Rails follows a very similar design philosophy to Django. Like Django it provides standard mechanisms for routing URLs, accessing data from a database, generating HTML from templates and formatting data as JSON or XML. It similarly encourages the use of design patterns like DRY ("don't repeat yourself" — write code only once if at all possible), MVC (model-view-controller) and a number of others.

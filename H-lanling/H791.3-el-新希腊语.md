### Accents

Modern Greek has only ONE accent, that is placed above the accented vowels, and it looks like this: ά,έ, ή, ί, ό, ύ, ώ. The accent goes on one of the three last syllables. Accents help you emphasize the right syllable. For example: "μαμά" "maMA, “βιβλίο” (veevLEEo), ''μιλώ'' (meeLO) etc.

    Capital letters can take accents ONLY on the first letter. However, it can be omitted. E.g ΌΧΙ / ΟΧΙ (Ohee), but ΕΣΥ (eSEE).

### Punctuation Marks

The Period, or full stop, the comma, and the exclamation mark are the same as English.

The Greek question mark looks just like the English semicolon ; and can be found on the Q when you are on the Greek keyb
